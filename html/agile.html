                            <p class="padding-top-19">Agile project management is a popular methodology used in software
                                development and other industries to manage projects in an iterative and flexible manner.
                                This approach emphasizes collaboration, continuous improvement, and delivering
                                high-quality products that meet the needs of customers.</p>
                            <p>It is based on the idea that projects should be broken down into smaller, manageable
                                pieces, and that the team should be empowered to make decisions and adapt to changing
                                requirements.</p>

                            <p class="padding-top-19">The concept of Agile project management can be traced back to the
                                1990s, when a group of software developers began to question traditional project
                                management methods. They found that these methods were too rigid and did not allow for
                                the flexibility and adaptability that was needed to deliver high-quality software in a
                                rapidly changing environment.</p>

                            <p class="padding-top-19">In 2001, a group of 17 software developers came together to create
                                the Agile Manifesto, which outlines the values and principles that guide Agile project
                                management. The manifesto emphasizes individuals and interactions, working software,
                                customer collaboration, and responding to change.</p>

                                <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
                                <li>Deliver working software frequently, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
                                </li>
                                <li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
                                <li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support
                                    they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>

                            <p class="padding-top-19">Scrum and Kanban are the two most popular Agile frameworks used in
                                software development.</p>
                            <h4 class="mb-3 f-s-20">What is Scrum?</h4>
                            <p>Scrum is a framework that emphasizes time-boxed sprints and cross-functional teams. It
                                involves a set of roles, ceremonies, and artifacts that help teams to deliver working
                                software in short iterations. The roles in Scrum include the Product Owner, Scrum
                                Master, and Development Team. The ceremonies include Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups,
                                Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective. The artifacts include the Product Backlog,
                                Sprint Backlog, and Increment.</p>
                            <h4 class="mb-3 f-s-20">What is Kanban?</h4>
                            <p>Kanban, on the other hand, is a framework that emphasizes continuous flow and visualizing
                                work. It is based on the principles of just-in-time production and the Toyota Production
                                System. Kanban involves visualizing work on a board and limiting work in progress to
                                improve flow and reduce waste. It does not have time-boxed iterations like Scrum, but
                                instead focuses on continuous delivery of working software.</p>

                            <p class="padding-top-19">The Agile workflow is an iterative process that involves planning,
                                executing, and delivering working software in short iterations. The Agile workflow
                                typically involves the following steps:</p>
                            <ul class="backlog-details list_unstyle">
                                <li><b>Planning:</b> In this phase, the team works with the product owner to create a
                                    product backlog, which is a prioritized list of features and requirements for the
                                    project. The team also creates a sprint backlog, which is a list of tasks that need
                                    to be completed during the sprint.</li>
                                <li><b>Execution:</b> During the execution phase, the team works to complete the tasks
                                    in the sprint backlog. This involves daily stand-ups, where the team discusses
                                    progress and any obstacles they are facing. The team also conducts regular sprint
                                    reviews to demonstrate the working software to the product owner and other
                                    stakeholders.</li>
                                <li><b>Delivery:</b> At the end of the sprint, the team delivers the working software to
                                    the product owner. This involves a sprint retrospective, where the team reflects on
                                    what went well and what could be improved in the next sprint.</li>

                            <p class="padding-top-19">In a nutshell, Agile project management methodology is a flexible
                                and collaborative approach to deliver software that is adaptable to changing
                                requirements and meets the needs of their customers. Whether you are a software
                                developer, project manager, or business owner, Agile project management can help you
                                deliver high-quality products in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
