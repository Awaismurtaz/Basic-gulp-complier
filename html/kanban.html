                                significant popularity are Scrum and Kanban. Both are part of Agile methodologies, which
                                focus on continuous improvement, flexibility, and customer satisfaction but work with
                                different approaches.</p>

                        <h4>Scrum: A Sprint-Based Approach</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p class="padding-top-19">Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together to deliver
                                complex products in iterative increments. It is characterized by its iterative nature,
                                where work is broken down into manageable chunks called "sprints." Each sprint typically
                                lasts 1-4 weeks and ends with a potentially shippable product increment.</p>
                            <p>In Scrum, roles are clearly defined. The Product Owner is responsible for the product
                                backlog, which is a prioritized list of features or tasks. The Development Team,
                                consisting of 3-9 members, is responsible for delivering the product increment. The
                                Scrum Master facilitates the process, ensuring that Scrum principles are being followed
                                and that the team is working effectively.</p>
                            <p>Scrum meetings include the daily stand-up, sprint planning, sprint review, and sprint
                                retrospective. These meetings help the team stay aligned, inspect and adapt their
                                progress, and continuously improve their process.</p>

                        <h4>Kanban: A Flow-Based Approach</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p class="padding-top-19">Kanban, on the other hand, is a visual system for managing work.
                                It focuses on continuous delivery and improving the flow of work. In Kanban, work is
                                visualized on a board, with columns representing different stages of work, such as "To
                                Do," "In Progress," and "Done."</p>
                            <p>Unlike Scrum, Kanban does not have defined roles or time-boxed iterations. Instead, it
                                limits the amount of work in progress (WIP), which helps to prevent bottlenecks and
                                improve the team's focus and efficiency.</p>
                            <p>In Kanban, the team pulls work from the "To Do" column when they have capacity, rather
                                than committing to a set amount of work at the beginning of a sprint. This allows for
                                greater flexibility and adaptability, as the team can respond to changes and new
                                priorities as they arise.</p>

                                <li><b>Roles:</b> Scrum has clearly defined roles, while Kanban does not.</li>

                            <p class="padding-top-19">The choice between Scrum and Kanban depends on the specific needs
                                of the team and context of the project. Scrum is often preferred for projects with a
                                clear end goal and a defined set of requirements. It works well for teams that thrive on
                                structure and predictability.</p>
                            <p>Kanban, on the other hand, is often preferred for projects with ongoing or evolving
                                requirements. It works well for teams that need to manage a high volume of work or
                                respond quickly to changing priorities.</p>
                            <p>In some cases, teams may choose to use a hybrid approach, combining elements of both
                                Scrum and Kanban. This can provide the benefits of both frameworks and allow the team to
                                tailor their process to their specific needs.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, both Scrum and Kanban are powerful tools in the Agile toolkit. They each
                                have their own strengths and are best suited to different types of projects and teams.
                                By understanding the key differences between Scrum and Kanban, teams can make an
                                informed decision about which framework to use, or how to combine elements of both to
                                create a process that works best for them.</p>
